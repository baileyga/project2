          Exercise is good for your mental and physical wellbeing.
          It can be a great coping mechanism to manage stress and anxiety.
          Some forms of exercise are more formal in gym environments, such as weight lifting or kickboxing.
          But, there are also outdoorsy activities, such as hiking, swimming, and rock climbing.
